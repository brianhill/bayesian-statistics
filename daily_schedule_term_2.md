### Week 2 &mdash; Combinatorics and Probability Distributions &mdash; Binomial Distribution &mdash; Variance

* Tuesday, Sept. 3 &mdash; Carefully read to p. 35 of Young (the end of Chapter 2) &mdash; Come prepared with any remaining questions about pp. 16-35 &mdash; Do the [Assignment for Tuesday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-09-03.nb.pdf)
* Friday, Sept. 6 &mdash; Carefully read to p. 57 of Young (stop just before he starts the Poisson distribution) &mdash; Come prepared with any remaining questions about pp. 39-57 &mdash; Do the [Assignment for Friday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-09-06.nb.pdf) &mdash; The relation between small changes, &ldquo;infinitesimal calculus,&rdquo; and partial derivatives (I finally explain equations 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 on p. 7) &mdash; The relation of the Poisson distribution to the binomial distribution (the tricky derivation on p. 59)

### Week 3 &mdash; Poisson Distribution &mdash; Histograms, Integrals, and Cumulative Distribution Functions

* Tuesday, Sept. 10 &mdash; Carefully read to p. 64 of Young (the Poisson distribution) &mdash; Do the [Assignment for Tuesday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-09-10.nb.pdf) &mdash; Histograms and Integrals &mdash; Discussion of Histogram, Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs), and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs), using deaths of males aged 0-109 as our example
* Friday, Sept 13 &mdash; To give everyone a break (especially me), there is no assignment due for Friday &mdash; Please use this time *to get started* on pp. 64-75 of Young, *but stop in that reading* as soon as you hit something that you really don't yet have the tools to understand, and come prepared with questions about the reading at the point that you decided to stop &mdash; Figures like Figure 9.2 on p. 68 should be starting to make sense given Tuesday's discussion

### Week 4 &mdash; Gaussian Distribution &mdash; Linear Regression &mdash; Goodness of Fit

* Tuesday, Sept. 17 &mdash; You will be doing your last major topic in Young (the Gaussian distribution), pp. 64-75, which you already started on last week &mdash; Do the [Assignment for Tuesday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-09-17.nb.pdf) &mdash; Warmup for Linear Regression
* Friday, Sept. 20 &mdash; Finish Chapter 3 of Young (to the end of Section 11, p. 86) &mdash; Do the [Assignment for Friday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-09-20.nb.pdf)

### Week 5 &mdash; Exam 1

* Tuesday, Sept. 24 &mdash; Exam 1 on Descriptive Statistics and Linear Regression
