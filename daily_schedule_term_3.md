* Friday, Nov. 1 &mdash; Study Chapter 6 of *Bayesian Statistics for Beginners* &mdash; Do the [Assignment for Friday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-11-01.nb.pdf) &mdash; Preparatory discussion for Chapters 8 and 9: [A Continuum of Hypotheses](./resources/AContinuumOfHypotheses.pdf) &mdash; NOTE: We skipped Chapter 7 because it introduced too little that is new

### Week 9 &mdash; Bayesian Statistics with Probability Distributions

* Tuesday, Nov. 5 &mdash; Dive in at the last half of Chapter 8, pp. 95-107 (if you also try to read pp. 88-94 of Chapter 8, I think you will find it to be a mind-numbing review of what we covered in Young) &mdash; Continue in Chapter 9, pp. 108-122 (this is yet more review of Young but in this case the review is useful) &mdash; Do the [Assignment for Tuesday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-11-05.nb.pdf) &mdash; We reviewed Bernoulli and Binomial Distributions, including the &ldquo;*n* choose *k*&rdquo; prefactor in the binomial distribution &mdash; We looked at the etymologty of the terms &ldquo;probability mass function (PMF)&rdquo; (an example of which is the Poisson distribution) as Donovan and Mickey use the term in Chapter 8, and &ldquo;probability density function (PDF)&rdquo; (an example of which is the Gaussian distribution) as Donovan and Mickey use the term in Chapter 9 &mdash; We started the [Assignment for Friday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-11-08.nb.pdf)

* Tuesday, Sept. 24 &mdash; [Exam 2](./exams/Exam2.nb.pdf) on Frequentist and Bayesian Statistics (covers Problem Sets 6 to 12 and Donovan and Mickey Chapters 1 to 9), including linear regression and the application of &chi;-squared
* Friday, Nov. 15 &mdash; Study Chapter 10 &mdash; Introducing Bayesian Conjugates &mdash; Please examine the [Assignment for Friday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-11-15.nb.pdf) which is not to be turned in &mdash; Instead it just contains ideas for how you could approach Chapter 10
