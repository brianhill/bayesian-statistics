## Daily Schedule Term 3

### Week 8 &mdash; Building Your Intuition with More Examples: Hamilton vs. Madison and a Mudslide with Pollen

* Tuesday, Oct. 29 &mdash; Study Chapter 5 of *Bayesian Statistics for Beginners* &mdash; Do the [Assignment for Tuesday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-10-29.nb.pdf) &mdash; Preparatory discussion for Chapter 6
* Friday, Nov. 1 &mdash; Study Chapter 6 of *Bayesian Statistics for Beginners* &mdash; Do the [Assignment for Friday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-11-01.nb.pdf) &mdash; Preparatory discussion for Chapter 9: [A Continuum of Hypothesis](./resources/AContinuumOfHypothesis.pdf)

*NB on language: I tend not to use the terms &ldquo;probability mass function (PMF)&rdquo; (an example of which is the Poisson distribution) as Donovan and Mickey do in Chapter 8, or &ldquo;probability density function (PDF)&rdquo; (an example of which is the Gaussian distribution) as Donovan and Mickey do in Chapter 9. Instead, I refer to both of these simply as &ldquo;probability distributions,&rdquo; and if I want to make a distinction between discrete and continuous distributions, I might just say &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; or &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; rather than PMF or PDF.*

### Week 9 &mdash; Bayesian Statistics with Probability Distributions

*Another note: Now we are going to do something a little unexpected! We are going to skip Chapter 7 because it introduces too little that is new. And we are going to skip some of Chapter 8, because it is going over the ideas we learned during the first few weeks of the course from Young. In Chapter 9 you will find that the mathematics notches up quite a bit, and that will indeed make building the intuition harder, but spending even a week on Chapters 7 and 8 will only delay us and not help with that.*

* Tuesday, Nov. 5 &mdash; Dive in at the last half of Chapter 8, pp. 95-107 (if you also try to read pp. 88-94 of Chapter 8, I think you will find it to be a mind-numbing review of what we covered in Young) &mdash; Continue in Chapter 9, pp. 108-122 (this is yet more review of Young but in this case the review is useful) &mdash; Do the [Assignment for Tuesday](./assignments/AssignmentFor2024-11-04.nb.pdf)
* Friday, Nov. 8 &mdash; Finish studying Chapter 9 of *Bayesian Statistics for Beginners*
